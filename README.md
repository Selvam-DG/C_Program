# C_Program
## I've started a journey to explore C programming, a language renowned for its low-level control and real-time capabilities.
#### In the exciting realm of mechatronics, where the combination of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering transforms ideas into automated reality, mastering C programming is a pivotal skill.
##### This programming knowledge will empower me to craft precise, responsive software for the mechatronic systems of the future.


#### Pointers
- Pointers are variables that hold addresses of other variables.
- A pointer to a pointer is a variable that holds the address of a pointer variable.
- The '&' operator fetches the address of the variable in memory.
- The * operator lets us access the value present at an address in memory with an intention of reading it or modifying it.
- A function can be called either by value or by reference.
- Pointers can be used to make a function return more than one value simultaneously in an indirect manner.
